## Code for Verifying Selected Text on a Webpage

Here is a JavaScript code snippet that you can run in the Chrome console to create a text verification tool. After executing the code, you can select any text on a webpage, and a new, draggable input block will appear over the selected text. This block allows you to re-type the text for verification, with color-coded feedback to indicate matching characters and inconsistencies.

### How to Use:

1.  **Open Chrome DevTools:** Right-click anywhere on a webpage and select "Inspect" from the context menu, or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
2.  **Go to the Console:** In the DevTools window, click on the "Console" tab.
3.  **Paste the Code:** Copy the entire code block below and paste it into the console.
4.  **Run the Code:** Press `Enter` to execute the script.
5.  **Select Text:** Now, on the webpage, select any piece of text with your mouse.
6.  **Verify Text:** An overlay will appear over the selected text. You can type in this overlay to verify the original text. The text you type will be colored green for correct characters and red for incorrect ones.
7.  **Drag the Block:** To move the verification block, hold down the `Ctrl` key and drag it with your mouse.
