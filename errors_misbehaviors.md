- when user input text "123456" into fields const inputArea = document.createElement('div') after the third character input cursor remains between "2" and "3". Final input looks like "126543"
- The cursor positioning issue has been 'fixed', but it's still very much a problem. I'll give another example:
User type "Sometimes" in the input fields appears "Sosemitem"
